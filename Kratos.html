                    Kratos is a title character and the protagonist of Santa Monica Studio's God of War series, which was based on Greek mythology. Kratos, also known as the "Ghost of Sparta", first appeared in the 2005 video game God of War, which led to the development of seven additional games featuring the character as the protagonist. Kratos also appears as the protagonist of the 2010 and 2018 comic series, as well as the franchise's three novels that retell the events of three of the games.
